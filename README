You will need the SDL library to compile this program
Instructions on how to get SDL can be found here: http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/lesson01/index.php

Controls:
    Left/Right          Move piece left and right
    Spacebar/Down       Drop piece

Notes:
    The most common grid size is 7 wide, 6 high, with 4 in a row to win. This program does support arbitrary sizes, however.
    The window size will be scaled proportional to the width and height of the grid. Each piece is 64x64 px
    Small grids may cause the ending graphic to be cut off or displayed funny.
