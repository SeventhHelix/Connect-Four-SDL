SDL
---

You will need the SDL library to compile this program
Instructions on how to get SDL, as well as some great tutorials on programming with SDL, can be found here: http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/lesson01/index.php

Notes
-----

The most common grid size is 7 wide, 6 high, with 4 in a row to win. This program does support arbitrary sizes, however.


The window size will be scaled proportional to the width and height of the grid. Each piece is 64x64 px


Small grids may cause the ending graphic to be cut off or displayed funny.
